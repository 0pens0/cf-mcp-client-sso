## Branch Management
- **ALWAYS** create a new branch for any code changes (e.g., `feature/new-feature`, `bugfix/issue-123`)
- **NEVER** modify the main branch unless explicitly requested by the user
- Use descriptive branch names following conventional patterns

## Documentation & Release Management
- **MANDATORY**: Document all code changes in commit messages and/or README updates
- **MANDATORY**: Create release notes documenting what changed, why, and any breaking changes
- Update version numbers following semantic versioning (major.minor.patch)
- Current version: 1.5.4 - increment appropriately (1.5.5 for patches, 1.6.0 for features, 2.0.0 for breaking changes)

## Version & Deployment Management
- **ALWAYS** increment the JAR file version in `pom.xml` when creating new releases
- **ALWAYS** update the Cloud Foundry manifest (`manifest.yml`) path to reflect the new JAR version
- Ensure the manifest service bindings match the application requirements (currently: SSO service)

## Testing Strategy
- **ALWAYS** use Cloud Foundry platform for testing new features/changes
- Create sandbox environments using new spaces with descriptive names
- Bind all required services (SSO, PostgreSQL, etc.) to the test space
- If no organization is specified, ask the user or create one with a descriptive name
- Clean up test spaces after validation unless user requests otherwise

## Tool Usage Priority
- **PRIMARY**: Use MCP servers and available tools for all operations
- **FALLBACK**: Only use CLI when MCP tools are insufficient or unavailable
- **TRANSPARENCY**: Always indicate when CLI fallback is necessary and explain why

## Code Quality Standards
- Follow Spring Boot best practices and conventions
- Maintain clean, well-documented Java code
- Ensure all changes are properly tested before deployment
- Use meaningful commit messages following conventional commit format
